Eastern boundary current upwelling systems are some of the most productive systems on the planet. Deep, nutrient rich water is advected into shallow shelf regions when prevailing winds drive Ekman transport of surface waters offshore. This nutrient-rich water supports high primary production, and sizeable fisheries in this region. However, the nutrient-rich source water is also relatively oxygen poor. Respiration of the sinking excess primary production near the seafloor drives dissolved oxygen concentration near to the physiological limit of marine organisms.

The effect of low oxygen - colloquially called "hypoxia" - on benthic and demersal organisms can be dramatic and apparent. However, much less is known about how oxygen influences planktonic organisms. 

In the northern California Current system, off the northwest coast of the United States, hypoxia occurs seasonally during the summer upwelling season. 

The goal of the first chapter of my PhD dissertation is to quantify the effects of low oxygen on zooplankton in the northern California Current. I am using data from the [In situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS)](https://hmsc.oregonstate.edu/planktonlab/research/sampling-technologies/isiis), deployed during the summer in 2018, 2019, 2022, and 2023.  

My aims are: 
- understand the abundance and distribution of important zooplankton taxa in relation to low oxygen.
- explore the indirect effects of how predation pressure and prey availability changes for larval fishes under different degrees of hypoxic stress.
- test hypotheses about the structure and functioning of zooplankton food webs in hypoxic and normoxic conditions.
