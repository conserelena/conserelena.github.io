Plankton imaging systems have provided revolutionary insight into fine-scale distributions of planktonic organisms. However, they are high-tech equipment, requiring specialized knowledge to deploy, collect data, and process data.

At the Oregon State University Plankton Ecology Lab, I have developed the skills to successfully deploy an ISIIS imager, and manage and process the ocean of data it produces. 

The In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS), also known as the Deep Plankton Imager (DPI) is a [Bellamare Occeanographic Systems](https://bellamare-us.com/isiis-dpi/) instrument.
