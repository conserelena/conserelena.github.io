Plankton imaging systems have provided revolutionary insight into fine-scale distributions of planktonic organisms. However, they are high-tech equipment, requiring specialized knowledge to deploy, collect data, and process data. It also represents a "big data" problem. Just 1 minute of imagery corresponds to ~10 GB of raw data, and instruments can be deployed for upwards of 12hours - equalling 72 TB from a single sampling event.

As a member of the Oregon State University Plankton Ecology Lab, I have developed the skills to successfully deploy an In situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) imager, and manage and process the ocean of data it produces. In the past two years, I have helped to develop a 180-class training image dataset, and trained and validated a YOLO deep learning classification model. Through our efforts, we have successfully classified over **16 billion** plankton and particle images. This classification and processing pipeline framework is currently being developed into a flexible, user-friendly pipeline by collaborators at Oregon State University.

I have served as deployment and data acquisition lead on three oceanographic research cruises (August 2023, September 2024, September 2025), and assisted on an additional cruises (March 2022, July 2023, February 2024). 

The In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS), also known as the Deep Plankton Imager (DPI) is a [Bellamare Occeanographic Systems](https://bellamare-us.com/isiis-dpi/) instrument.
