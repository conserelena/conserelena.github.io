The early life stages of fishes represents a critical period to predicting fisheries production for marine teleosts. Large numbers of eggs are spawned into a dynamic, pelagic environment. Finding prey and avoiding predation are hypothesized to be key determinants for survival and subsequently contribution to adult populations.

The English sole *Parophrys vetulus* is one of the most abundant winter-spawned larvae in the northern California Current. Adults contribute significant biomass of the nearshore groundfish population in this region. Unique to larvae in this region, English sole are highly selective feeders on filter-feeding appendicularians. This high degree of prey specificity lends to an ability to explore how prey abundance can relate to key factors influencing larval survivorship - feeding and growth. 


To understand how environmental conditions, trophic environment (predator + prey abundance), and feeding relate to growth, I am combining traditional and modern plankton techniques. I am using otolith microstructure analysis to quantify recent growth from English sole larvae spawned in 4 years. For these same fish, I performed gut contents analysis, identifying and quantifying consumed prey biomass. Finally, I am using data from the In situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) to provide appendicularian (prey) and gelatinous predator abundance. I aim to formulate a structural equations model to understand the direct and indirect mechanisms influencing larval growth in this species.
