I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in the Oregon State Department of Integrative Biology. I am a member of the [Plankton Ecology Lab](https://hmsc.oregonstate.edu/planktonlab), based at Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon. 

My primary research interests are **plankton imaging systems**, **zooplankton ecology**, and **early life histories of fishes**. 

I am currently seeking post-doctoral scholar positions after my anticipated PhD Defense date in September 2026.
